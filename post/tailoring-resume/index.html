<meta name=description content="In today&rsquo;s competitive job market, a one-size-fits-all resume simply won’t cut it. Recruiters and hiring managers receive hundreds of applications per role, and research shows that they spend an average of 6-7 seconds scanning each resume (Ladders, 2018). To stand out, job seekers must tailor their resumes to highlight the most relevant skills, experience, and achievements that align with the specific role they’re applying for.
The Role of Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) Most companies use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to filter resumes before they even reach human eyes. According to Jobscan, 75% of resumes are never seen by a recruiter because they don’t contain the right keywords (Jobscan, 2023). By carefully analyzing the job description and incorporating relevant industry-specific keywords, applicants can increase their chances of passing ATS filters and landing an interview.

According to Jobscan, <strong>75% of resumes are never seen by a recruiter</strong> because they don’t contain the right keywords (Jobscan, 2023).

Career expert Amanda Augustine from TopResume advises job seekers to focus on three key areas when tailoring a resume:</p><ol><li><strong>Professional Summary:</strong> Rewrite this section to highlight qualifications that match the job posting.</li><li><strong>Skills Section:</strong> Use exact terms from the job description to ensure alignment.</li><li><strong>Experience and Achievements:</strong> Reframe past roles to emphasize relevant accomplishments that prove your ability to excel in the new position.</li></ol><h3 id=final-thoughts>Final Thoughts</h3><p>Tailoring your resume doesn’t mean fabricating experience; it means strategically presenting your qualifications in a way that best fits the role. In a job market where employers seek candidates who can immediately add value, customizing your resume for each application increases your odds of getting noticed, passing ATS filters, and ultimately securing interviews.</p></div></div><footer class="py-3 mt-auto bg-light"><div class="container py-1 my-1"><div class="d-flex flex-wrap justify-content-between align-items-center"><p class="col-md mb-0 text-muted">Leyla Theunissen</p><ul class="nav col-md-auto justify-content-end"><li class=nav-item><a href=/code-of-conduct/ class="nav-link px-2 text-muted" title='Code of Conduct' aria-label='Code of Conduct'>Code of Conduct</a></li></ul></div></div></footer><script src=/js/main.min.e8d88c82c0438b527f1aca4115652ba1e2877bf805b75593b23ac0e3fe2b3fe95a467d1feef275355132ba061da6404b0d24d55afabc209b294b1db043be014d.js integrity="sha512-6NiMgsBDi1J/GspBFWUroeKHe/gFt1WTsjrA4/4rP+laRn0f7vJ1NVEyugYdpkBLDSTVWvq8IJspSx2wQ74BTQ==" crossorigin=anonymous defer></script></body></html>
